## ANIMATION I WILL BUILD

When you tap the bird in the app:

```
0.0s   → Bird image swaps to flying version
0.0-0.4s → Bird zooms off screen (translateX + translateY + rotate)  
0.4-0.7s → Screen swipes to Add Entry tab
0.7s   → Add Entry tab visible, bird back in idle state
```

Total: ~0.7 seconds

## AFTER MIDJOURNEY

1. Run each image through **remove.bg** to clean up background
2. Save to `/public/` folder with the filenames above
3. Tell me when ready and I'll wire up the animation!
